An IP-monitoring script for both Windows (as a service using nssm) and Linux (as a systemd daemon). Iâ€™ve included downloadable template files and clear instructionsâ€”ready to zip up!

```bash
git clone [https://github.com/Shunzab/IPCatcher]
cd [IPCatcher]
```

## Windows Package (nssm Service)

Files included:
